## Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python program for classifying breast cancer data using machine learning.

## Overview

The program uses the sklearn library to load the breast cancer dataset, and then trains a neural network to classify the data. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the binary cross-entropy loss function.

## Features

* Loads breast cancer dataset from sklearn
* Preprocesses the loaded data
* Splits data into training and testing sets
* Trains a neural network with 2 hidden layers and 15 neurons each
* Uses ReLU activation function for hidden layers and Sigmoid activation function for output layer
* Optimizes the model using Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function
* Evaluates the model's performance on both training and testing sets
  
## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* sklearn
* torch
* numpy

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the program  `python Breast Cancer torch.ipynb`

## Notes

* This program is for educational purposes only and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.
* The performance of the model may vary depending on the dataset and hyperparameters.
